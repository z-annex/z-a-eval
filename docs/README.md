Annex provides a completion file with the prefix _zi, the 'shim' below which will run all available zi completions and the shim is assigned as ZIs completion with a compdef call

Synopsis:

```shell
zi recache <plugin/snippet>
```

## üí° Wiki

- [annexes](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/ecosystem/annexes)

## Installation

Simply load like a regular plugin:

```shell
zi light z-shell/z-a-eval
```

After executing this command you can then use the new ice-mods provided by
the annex.

## How it works

The output of a slow initialization command is redirected to a file located within the plugin/snippets directory and sourced while loading. The next time the plugin/snippet is loaded, this file will be sourced skipping the need to run the initialization command.
